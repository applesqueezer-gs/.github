# What is the AppleSqueezer GS?

The AppleSqueezer GS is an **accelerator + 14MB memory expansion + HDMI out + 224MB RAM disk** for the Apple IIGS, built from scratch with modern components. It uses an FPGA in addition to a 14MHz 65816. It's simple to install: all you have to do is remove the existing 65816 CPU from the IIGS motherboard, and plug the AppleSqueezer GS in its place. From that moment forward, your GS will be accelerated! It will run faster than ever before, and have 14MB of RAM. In addition, you will have access to a 32MB or 224MB RAM disk. The new AppleSqueezer GS v2 also has HDMI video output.
